          <p>
            Welcome to <strong>brokebot</strong> - your privacy-first AI assistant! These terms of service outline the rules and
            regulations for the use of our application and explain exactly how your data is handled.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
          <p>
            By accessing and using brokebot, you accept and agree to be bound by
            these terms and provisions. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use our application.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">2. Our Privacy-First Approach</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>brokebot is designed with privacy as the core principle.</strong> Here's exactly what happens with your data:
          </p>
          
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">üîí Local Data Processing</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Conversations:</strong> All your chat messages and conversations are stored locally in your browser using IndexedDB. They never leave your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Files:</strong> Any documents you upload (.txt, .md files) are processed and stored entirely on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Your preferences, selected models, and configuration remain local.</li>
            <li><strong>Local AI Models:</strong> When using WebLLM models, all processing happens directly in your browser with no data transmission.</li>
            <li><strong>API Keys:</strong> If you provide your own API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google), they are encrypted using strong AES-256-GCM encryption with user-specific keys derived via PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations) and stored only in your browser's local storage.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">üåê What Goes Online</h3>
          <p>Only two features require internet connectivity and data transmission:</p>
          
          <h4 className="text-lg font-medium mt-4 mb-2">A) User Authentication (Optional)</h4>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Service:</strong> Powered by Appwrite (open-source backend)</li>
            <li><strong>Data sent:</strong> Only your email and chosen username for account creation</li>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Enables cloud sync and conversation sharing features</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> All authentication data is encrypted and follows industry standards</li>
            <li><strong>Optional:</strong> You can use brokebot completely offline without creating an account</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-medium mt-4 mb-2">B) OpenRouter Free Models</h4>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
            <li><strong>What's sent:</strong> Your chat messages and prompts when using free OpenRouter models</li>
            <li><strong>Trade-off:</strong> In exchange for free access, OpenRouter may use your prompts to improve their models</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> This is clearly indicated in the model selection interface</li>
            <li><strong>Alternative:</strong> Use local WebLLM models or your own API keys for complete privacy</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">üîê External Encryption Services</h3>
          <p>When using your own API keys, brokebot employs additional security measures:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Server-Side Encryption:</strong> API keys are re-encrypted on our secure Appwrite functions before being sent to AI providers</li>
            <li><strong>User-Specific Keys:</strong> Each user gets a unique encryption key derived from their user ID using cryptographic key derivation (PBKDF2)</li>
            <li><strong>No Key Storage:</strong> The master encryption key is stored only in server environment variables and never logged or persisted</li>
            <li><strong>Transit Security:</strong> All communications use HTTPS/TLS encryption</li>
            <li><strong>Zero Knowledge:</strong> Even our servers cannot decrypt your API keys without your specific user context</li>
            <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> You can inspect the encryption functions in our GitHub repository and even deploy your own instance</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">3. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Remains on your device until you manually delete it or clear browser data</li>
            <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> If you create an account, you can delete it anytime through settings</li>
            <li><strong>Conversation Exports:</strong> You can export your conversations as JSON or Markdown files</li>
            <li><strong>Complete Control:</strong> You have full control over all your data at all times</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">4. User Conduct and Responsibilities</h2>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">You agree to:</h3>

          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
            <li>The content of your conversations and any files you upload</li>
            <li>Maintaining the security of your own API keys if you choose to use them</li>

            <li>Backing up your local data if desired (we provide export functionality)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">5. Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>brokebot integrates with several third-party services:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Appwrite:</strong> For optional user authentication and cloud features</li>
            <li><strong>OpenRouter:</strong> For access to various AI models (when you choose to use them)</li>
            <li><strong>WebLLM:</strong> For local AI model execution (no data leaves your device)</li>
            <li><strong>Model Providers:</strong> OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (only when you provide your own API keys)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each third-party service has its own terms of service and privacy policy. 
            We encourage you to read them to understand how your data is handled.
